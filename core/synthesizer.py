**AI COUNCIL RESPONSES:**{responses_section}

**SYNTHESIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Analyze all responses** for their unique strengths and insights
2. **Identify the best elements** from each council member's contribution
3. **Resolve any contradictions** using your reasoning
4. **Synthesize a superior response** that:
   - Combines the strongest insights from all responses
   - Maintains coherent structure and flow
   - Eliminates redundancy while preserving valuable details
   - Provides the most comprehensive and accurate answer
   - Improves upon individual responses where possible

**SYNTHESIS REQUIREMENTS:**
- Be more comprehensive than any individual response
- Maintain the tone and approach appropriate for the template used
- Credit insights where multiple models agreed (shows consensus)
- Resolve disagreements with clear reasoning
- Structure the response clearly and professionally

## Original File: {source_file_path.name}

## Processing Template Used: {template_used}

## Original Code:

{original_code[:1000]}... # Truncated for context


## Council Member Responses:
{formatted_responses}

## Your Task:
Analyze all the responses from the AI Council members and create a synthesized output that:

1. **Combines the Best Insights**: Identify the strongest points from each response and integrate them cohesively
2. **Resolves Contradictions**: Where responses disagree, use your judgment to determine the best approach
3. **Enhances Completeness**: Fill any gaps that individual responses might have missed
4. **Maintains Consistency**: Ensure the final output has a consistent style and structure
5. **Adds Meta-Insights**: Provide any additional insights that emerge from seeing all perspectives

## Synthesis Guidelines:
- Preserve the format expected by the template ({template_used})
- Prioritize correctness and best practices
- When in doubt, favor the approach that appears in multiple responses
- Add brief notes about significant synthesis decisions in comments

## Output Format:
Provide the synthesized result that represents the collective wisdom of the AI Council, enhanced by your architectural oversight.
