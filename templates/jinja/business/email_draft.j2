❌ **Vague requests** - Be specific about what you need
❌ **No next steps** - Always indicate what happens next
❌ **Wrong tone** - Match formality to relationship
❌ **Over-apologizing** - Apologize once if needed, move on
❌ **Multiple topics** - One email = one main topic
❌ **Unclear subject** - Subject should summarize purpose

**Remember**: The best emails are short, clear, and make it easy for the recipient to respond or take action. Respect the reader's time.
