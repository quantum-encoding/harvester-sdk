### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

‚ùå **Verbatim transcription** - Summarize, don't transcribe
‚ùå **Burying action items** - Make them prominent
‚ùå **Vague owners** - "Team" is not an owner
‚ùå **Missing deadlines** - Every action needs a "when"
‚ùå **No context** - Include enough background
‚ùå **Too detailed** - Focus on decisions and actions
‚ùå **Ignoring disagreements** - Note different perspectives
‚ùå **Forgetting follow-up** - Always plan next steps

### Special Considerations

**Sensitive Topics**:
- Use appropriate discretion
- Note if something is confidential
- Consider separate documentation for sensitive items

**Distributed Teams**:
- Account for timezone differences
- Note who was remote
- Include recording link if available

**Board/Executive Meetings**:
- More formal tone
- Focus on strategic items
- Include voting results if applicable
- Document governance items

**Recurring Meetings**:
- Link to previous meeting notes
- Track ongoing items across meetings
- Note progress on long-term initiatives

**Remember**: A great meeting summary makes everyone's time investment worthwhile by ensuring decisions get executed and nothing falls through the cracks.
