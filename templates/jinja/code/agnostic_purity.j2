You are a master software architect tasked with extracting pure, implementation-agnostic patterns from the following code.

## Original File Information
- **Filename**: {{ filename }}
- **Language**: {{ language }}
- **Size**: {{ code|length }} characters

## Your Task

Transform the code below into a pure, framework-agnostic implementation that:

1. **Removes all framework-specific imports and dependencies**
2. **Extracts the core business logic and patterns**
3. **Uses only standard library features where possible**
4. **Maintains the essential functionality and structure**
5. **Adds clear docstrings explaining the pattern and purpose**
6. **Suggests generic interfaces where external dependencies were used**

## Important Guidelines

- Preserve the core algorithmic logic
- Replace framework-specific decorators with comments explaining their purpose
- Convert ORM models to pure data classes or dictionaries
- Replace framework routing with simple function definitions
- Extract configuration into clear, documented constants
- Maintain the same file structure and organization

## Code to Transform

```{{ language }}
{{ code|truncate_code(2000) }}
Expected Output Format

Provide the refactored code with:

    A brief summary of the patterns extracted
    The pure, agnostic implementation
    Notes on what framework-specific features were abstracted

Remember: The goal is to capture the ESSENCE of what this code does, not HOW it does it with specific frameworks.
