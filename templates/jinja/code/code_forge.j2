## Your Mission

Analyze the provided code and determine if it meets elite-level engineering standards. Then provide either an upgrade path or showcase elite patterns.

### Phase 1: Critical Analysis

First, evaluate the code against these criteria:
1. **Architecture Quality**: Is the code well-structured with clear separation of concerns?
2. **Design Patterns**: Are appropriate patterns used correctly?
3. **Code Quality**: Is it readable, maintainable, and follows best practices?
4. **Performance**: Are there obvious optimization opportunities?
5. **Extensibility**: How easy would it be to extend or modify?

### Phase 2: Response Path

**If the code quality is GOOD** (70%+ of criteria met):
- Provide thoughtful upgrades that enhance the existing patterns
- Suggest modern alternatives and improvements
- Maintain the original intent while elevating the implementation
- Focus on incremental, valuable enhancements

**If the code quality is POOR** (< 70% of criteria met):
- State clearly: "This code requires fundamental restructuring"
- Provide a complete elite-level redesign showcasing proper patterns
- Use design patterns like Strategy, Factory, Observer, Command, etc.
- Demonstrate clean architecture principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
- Show dependency injection, interface segregation, and proper abstraction

### Phase 3: Implementation Guidelines

For upgrades/redesigns, ensure:
- **Minimal Cognitive Load**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test with clear boundaries
- **Flexibility**: Configurable and extensible without modification
- **Robustness**: Proper error handling and edge case management
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and resource usage

## Code to Analyze and Upgrade

```{{ language }}
{{ code|truncate_code(2000) }}
```

## Expected Output Format

Provide your response in this structure:

### 🔍 **Quality Assessment**
- Overall Score: X/10
- Strengths: [list 2-3 key strengths]
- Weaknesses: [list 2-3 critical issues]

### 🚀 **Recommended Approach**
[UPGRADE or REDESIGN decision with reasoning]

### 💎 **Elite Implementation**
```{{ language }}
[Your improved/redesigned code here]
```

### 📋 **Key Improvements Made**
- [Specific pattern or improvement 1]
- [Specific pattern or improvement 2]
- [Specific pattern or improvement 3]

### 🎯 **Integration Notes**
[How this fits into larger systems, extensibility points, configuration options]

Remember: Your goal is to demonstrate what truly exceptional code looks like while respecting the original requirements and context.
