## 🛡️ QUALITY GUARDIAN - AUTOMATED CODE REMEDIATION ANALYSIS

> **This is an automated response from the Quality Guardian system. Faulty or placeholder code has been detected in this implementation. Please analyze the findings and implement the corrections.**

## Guardian Detection Summary

The Quality Guardian has identified violations or placeholder implementations in this code that must be resolved before deployment.

## Your Task

Analyze the code below and provide corrected, production-ready implementations that resolve ALL violations:

1. **Eliminate ALL placeholder patterns** (TODO, FIXME, dummy implementations)
2. **Implement proper dependency injection** where appropriate
3. **Ensure stateless service design** for scalability
4. **Apply correct abstraction layers** for maintainability
5. **Ensure backwards compatibility** with existing patterns
6. **Add proper error handling** for all edge cases
7. **Include necessary validation** for inputs and outputs

## Code Under Analysis

```{{ language }}
{{ code|truncate(3000) if code|length > 3000 else code }}
```

## Expected Output Format

Provide your analysis and corrections in this exact format:

1. **Violation Summary** - List all architectural violations found
2. **Corrected Implementation** - Complete, production-ready code with all violations resolved
3. **Implementation Notes** - Brief explanation of what was fixed and why

## Critical Reminders

- This is **automated quality enforcement** - not a conversation
- Every line must be **production-ready and functional**
- **No placeholders or incomplete implementations** except for API keys and environment variables
- Code must integrate seamlessly with the **project architecture**
- Focus on **functional implementation**, not explanations
