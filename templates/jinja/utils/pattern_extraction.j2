You are an expert software architect specializing in design pattern recognition and extraction.

## Task: Extract Design Patterns

Analyze the following code and identify:

1. **Architectural Patterns** (MVC, Repository, Factory, etc.)
2. **Design Patterns** (Singleton, Observer, Strategy, etc.)
3. **Code Patterns** (Error handling, validation, data transformation)
4. **Anti-patterns** that should be refactored

## Code to Analyze

**File**: {{ filename }}
**Language**: {{ language }}

```{{ language }}
{{ code|truncate_code(1500) }}

Expected Output

Provide a structured analysis:
1. Identified Patterns

List each pattern found with:

    Pattern name
    Pattern type (architectural/design/code)
    Location in code
    Brief explanation

2. Pattern Implementation

For each major pattern, show the pure, framework-agnostic implementation.
3. Recommendations

    Patterns that could be applied
    Anti-patterns to refactor
    Architectural improvements

Focus on extracting reusable, framework-independent patterns that can be applied across different projects.
